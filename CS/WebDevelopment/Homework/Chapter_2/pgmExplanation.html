    <h1>
        Controlling Multiple Servos Using Arduino Serial connection
    </h1><br>
    <p>
    <h2>
        Problem Overview:
    </h2>

        After 3d printing and assembling a claw robot that would be controlled by an arduino, a method of feeding servo number and position was needed.
        The user interface of the claw was created using Windows forms on Visual Studio. This interface allowed us to create individual sliders that
        could be assigned to specific motors. After having created the desktop app to be able to send the information I learned that the serial monitor
        passes information over a single line in binary. This required a different method of deciphering the information that was passed into the arduino
        in order to control it from the app.
        <br>
    <h2>
        How arduino recommends you solve this problem:
    </h2>

        void setup()   /****** SETUP: RUNS ONCE ******/<br>
        {<br>
        Serial.begin(9600);<br>
        Serial.println("--- Start Serial Monitor SEND_RCVE ---");<br>
        Serial.println(" Type in Box above, . ");<br>
        Serial.println("(Decimal)(Hex)(Character)");<br>
        Serial.println();<br>
        }<br>
        //--(end setup )---<br>
        <br>
        void loop()   /****** LOOP: RUNS CONSTANTLY ******/<br>
        {<br>
        if (Serial.available() > 0)<br>
        {<br>
        ByteReceived = Serial.read();<br>
        Serial.print(ByteReceived);<br>
        Serial.print("        ");<br>
        Serial.print(ByteReceived, HEX);<br>
        Serial.print("       ");<br>
        Serial.print(char(ByteReceived));<br>
        <br>
        if(ByteReceived == '1') // Single Quote! This is a character.<br>
        {<br>
        digitalWrite(led,HIGH);<br>
        Serial.print(" LED ON ");<br>
       }<br>
        <br>
        if(ByteReceived == '0')<br>
        {<br>
        digitalWrite(led,LOW);<br>
        Serial.print(" LED OFF");<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        Serial.println();    // End the line<br>
        <br>
        // END Serial Available<br>
        }<br>
        }<br>

    <h2>
        What this does:<br>
        <br>
        Step 1:
    </h2>
        This code first outlines the method of parsing the information that will be sent over the serial monitor simply and quickly.
        It first makes sure that Serial monitor connection is working. This will let it know when to begin parsing the
        information that it is being fed.
    <h2>
        Step 2:
    </h2>
        Next it will take that information and parse it into the different channels based on what the byte is. This will result
        in an output of 1 or 0. Once that is done the corresponding light will be set to High (on).
    <h2>
        Adapting this to solve our problem:
    </h2>
        The final step to this process is useful to us as it shows how you can channel the information and allow multiple LED's to
        be controlled simultaneously. This will only be changed to have more values as options. Each of these values will be used to
        assign a number to a servo. <br>
        The second part of the adaptation will be to convert the value its looking for to be an assigned character. The first character
        that will be searched for will begin the parse and the second character will end the parse. This will allow for two values to be
        passed along. One will be the servo you would like to change, and the second would be the position you would like to put it in.<br>
