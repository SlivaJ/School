# School
This is where I keep school work so I don't have to hold files locally. 

File structure will be:  School>Major>Class>

Note: This is not a complete list of classes that I have taken.
I will update it as I go through my files and see what I think is worth saving.
If you are interested in a complete list of what I know/classes I have taken, email me at JCSliva1999@Gmail.com

I should have started this earlier but better late than never I suppose.
